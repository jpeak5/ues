# CPS Enrollment Module

The CPS (Course Preference System) enrollment module, is a pluggable
course creation / enrollment system that adheres to some common university
constraints. The module enhances the Moodle course and user tables with
some meta information for course creation.


Upon installation, the enrollment modules creates tables for the following
information:

 * Semesters
 * Courses (Departments, numbers, titles)
 * Sections (Inidividual courses or groups within a single Moodle course)
 * Teacher Enrollment
 * Student Enrollment
 * Extra user information (year, college, major, anything you want)

More on this when it fleshes out.
